This folder contains a function  "grid_nugap_metric.m" which can be used for gridding the parameter space 
by utilizing the nu-gap metric.

The function takes as input the state space matrices as function handles of the scheduling variable, the minimum and 
maximum values of the scheduling variables and threshold for model comparison and outputs the parameter grid.
